This is a very old project I did for a minecraft server.  
It creates a minigame where you have to capture a wool block from the enemy base and bring it to you own - capture the flag basicly.  
Along the way towers can be captured, that throw harming potions at the enemies to block them accessing your base.  

It was originally built against bukkit api 1.6. It also has a couple of dependencies that I don't really know anymore so good luck to try to compile it :).
